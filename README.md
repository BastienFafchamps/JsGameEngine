# JsGameEngine

A small game engine and game making environnement in Javascript.
It as a build-in **code editor, sprite editor and music / sound maker.**

It is contained in a single html file, no external resources and thus can be used localy and offline.

This was made witout using npm as it does use any library. Run the build.js using node to "compile" the few js and css files into a single index.html.

Feel free to check the source code and use some of it.
